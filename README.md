# Would You Rather Game Project

This final assessment project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program. \_DATA.js was the only starter code provided because it served as a fake database for the application

This app allows a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

The questions are asked by other users and the user wiil be able to create polls/questions themselves and see a leaderboard on how their contibutions rank amongst other players/users.
